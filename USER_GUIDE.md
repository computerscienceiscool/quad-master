## Getting Started

### What is Quad Master?

Quad Master is a unique productivity app that helps you organize your life into four meaningful areas (quadrants). Unlike traditional to-do lists, Quad Master helps you maintain balance across all areas of your life while building lasting habits through streak tracking and smart reminders.

### First Launch

When you first open Quad Master, you'll create your personalized board:

1. **Name Your Quadrants** (4 steps)
   - Choose a name for each quadrant (e.g., "Health", "Career", "Family", "Learning")
   - Pick a color for each quadrant
   - These represent the four main areas of your life

2. **Common Quadrant Examples**
   - **Life Balance**: Body, Mind, Career, Relationships
   - **Student**: Academics, Career Prep, Health, Social
   - **Entrepreneur**: Product, Sales, Team, Health
   - **Parent**: Kids, Self-Care, House, Partner
   - **Creative**: Create, Learn, Share, Rest

### The Home Screen

After setup, you'll see your four-quadrant board:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   HEALTH    │   CAREER    │
│   (Yellow)  │   (Red)     │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│   FAMILY    │  LEARNING   │
│   (Green)   │   (Blue)    │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

In the center, you'll see a split circle:
- **Top half (black)**: Daily tasks
- **Bottom half (white)**: Weekly tasks

## Streaks & History

### What Are Streaks?

A streak is how many days (or weeks) in a row you've completed a task. Streaks help you build lasting habits by visualizing your consistency.

### How Streaks Work

**Daily Task Streaks**
- Complete the task today → Streak increases
- Skip a day → Streak resets to 0
- Complete yesterday AND today → Streak continues

**Weekly Task Streaks**
- Complete the task this week → Streak increases
- Skip a week → Streak resets to 0
- Complete last week AND this week → Streak continues

### Streak Levels

Streaks are color-coded by achievement level:

🔥 **Blue** (1-6 days/weeks)
- You're getting started
- Keep the momentum going!

💪 **Green** (7-13 days/weeks)
- One week strong!
- You're building a habit

⭐ **Orange** (14-29 days/weeks)
- Two weeks or more!
- You're crushing it

🏆 **Purple** (30+ days/weeks)
- A full month or more!
- You're a champion

### Viewing Streaks

**On Task Lists:**
- Look for the colored badge next to task names
- Shows emoji + number (e.g., 🔥7)

**Task Details:**
1. Long-press any task
2. See streak info in the bottom sheet
3. View total completions

**Weekly Summary:**
1. Settings → Weekly Summary
2. See average streaks per quadrant
3. See your best streak for each quadrant

### Completion History

Every time you complete a task, it's recorded:
- Date and time saved
- Last 90 days kept (older entries auto-deleted)
- Used for streak calculation
- Visible in long-press menu

### Protecting Your Streaks

**Delete Warning:**
When deleting a task with an active streak, you'll see:
```
⚠️ Warning!
You have a 14 day streak!
Are you sure you want to delete this task?
```

**Undo Feature:**
- If you accidentally complete a task, undo immediately
- Your streak stays intact

💡 **Pro Tip**: Don't break the chain! Even on busy days, try to maintain your streaks.

**Forgive and Restart**

### Quadrant Balance

**The 4-Quadrant Philosophy**

Your quadrants represent life areas. True success means balance:

- Focusing only on Career? Health and relationships suffer
- Only on Health? Career may stagnate
- Neglecting Learning? Growth stops

**Balance Check (Weekly)**
1. Review your completion rates per quadrant
2. Is one quadrant consistently low?
3. Either reduce tasks in that quadrant or commit to doing them

**The 80/20 Rule**
- Aim for 80% completion across all quadrants
- Perfect isn't necessary; consistency is

### Notification Strategy

**Morning**: Review mode
- Check what's ahead
- Prioritize your day
- Knock out one quick task

**Mid-Day**: Reality check
- Are you on track?
- If not, adjust afternoon plans
- Quick wins boost motivation

**Evening**: Final push
- Complete remaining tasks
- Or accept what you've done
- Plan for tomorrow

### Template Power

**Create Template Bundles**

*Morning Routine Bundle:*
- "Meditate 10 min"
- "Review daily goals"
